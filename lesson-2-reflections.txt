Explain the Android System Architecture?

	- The Android System Architecture at the simplest contains four layers:
			- App: this layer is on the top and is the actual app functionality which the developers implement
			- Framework: The Android Framework provides the developers bunch of tools which he or she can use
			to make powerful actions with just a few lines of code.
			- Android OS: This layer connects the app with the Physical Hardware Layer and does pretty much
			all of the weight lifting, meaning that all the big functionalities of the app are completed by
			the Android OS.
			- Physical Hardware Layer: this layer is triggered by the Android OS itself and this layer contains
			all the hardware on the device like CPU, GPU, microchips, etc.
