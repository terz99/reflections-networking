What is an Android permission?

	- By default, the app does not have permission to do some actions if they are not prior permitted. Usually those actions 
	involve communication with other apps or the internet. So before using the internet or sending a text message via your app 
	or using the camera, permission must be set in the AndroidManifest.xml
